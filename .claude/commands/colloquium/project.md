# Colloquium Project

Manage standalone projects inside the Colloquium monorepo — bootstrap new ones or continue development on existing ones.

Invoke as:
/colloquium:project → prompts new or continue
/colloquium:project <slug> → continue the named project directly

**Version:** v3 — Bootstrap + Develop flows, per-project state under .claude/projects/

## ENFORCEMENT RULES (read before executing any step)

1. **Always ask first.** Every invocation starts at Phase 0. No silent assumptions about new vs. continue.
2. **State after every step.** Write `project-state.json` after EVERY step — not after phases, not in batches.
3. **Banners are mandatory.** Every phase and step displays its start and completion banner.
4. **Hard gates block.** Steps marked HARD GATE loop until the gate condition is met — do NOT proceed without it.
5. **feature_list.json is append-only.** Only the `"passes"` field may be changed. Descriptions, steps, and ordering are NEVER modified.
6. **AI never touches git beyond reading status.** No branch creation, no push, no PR — the human controls all git operations. The ONE exception: the initial scaffold commit in Phase B3 (explicitly described below).
